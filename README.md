# Logical-Shifting-in-Python-Automated
This is a program that helps programmers interested in monitoring and control systems to work with binary shifting easily without manually shifting the values
For example:

  When developing sensors, there can be changes in the environment as sensors capture physical properties. The best example is a proximity sensor
  of mobile phones. 
  As the proximity value changes, the sensors can detect this change and act accordingly..
  The binary values working behind the sensor in the processor needs some manipulation which can be a Bit manipulation techniques usage. 
  Most developers manually enter the data for the changes in the binary value. These can mostly be pre-written by programmers for sensors
  to act upon a change in the physical environment. 
  This program can let developers (programmers) of sensors or any control systems use the bit manipulation techniques easily.
  More will be added to this program to fully automatically change the bits without human intervention. This is still a semi-auto project for testing
  the bit manipulation on systems rather than working on it manually.
